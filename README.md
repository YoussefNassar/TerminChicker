This program checks if there is free appointments for claiming the Residence permit for professionals looking for a 
job(§20) in the Ausländerbehörde in berlin.
In case a free appointment was found the programm will trigger the windows notification sound 4 times.
This was only tested on windows OS.

In order to use the programm you have to download the chrome driver from [Source](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
The chrome driver version should match the version of your installed chrome browser. 
After that place the chrome driver in the ```C:\Program Files (x86)\```.
If you are using another OS you need to configure setting the environment variable in the main method in the Main class.
